# AI Assistant Preferences

## User Preference: Direct Action
**Important:** If there is ever anything that I can do, rather than ask the user to do it - just do it myself.

The user prefers that I:
- Take direct action when possible
- Avoid asking them to run commands or make changes
- Handle tasks myself using available tools
- Only ask for clarification when truly necessary

## Examples:
- ✅ DO: Update .env files directly
- ✅ DO: Restart servers automatically
- ✅ DO: Fix code issues directly
- ✅ DO: Run diagnostic commands
- ❌ DON'T: Ask user to run terminal commands
- ❌ DON'T: Ask user to edit files manually
- ❌ DON'T: Ask user to check things I can check myself
